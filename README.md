## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Twitter, Spotify, Pinterest
Twitter: Enchanced thread filters
Spotify: Song Collaborations and Curated Playlist
Pinterest:  Pereonalized Collection and collaborative boards

## Notes
Mastering @IBAction: Through hands-on practice and dedicated learning in this course, 
I aim to harness the power of @IBAction connections and enhance my technical prowess. 
With each step forward, I aspire to transform newfound knowledge into a tangible 
application, showcasing the evolution of my skills and creativity in the world of app development.
